    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: 20 May 2025</em></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the <strong>StarBurst Idle</strong> mobile application ("Application"), developed and published by Bolster Solutions ("Service Provider") as a 
        Freemium service. This service is provided "AS IS".</p><br>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>User Provided Information</h3>
    <p>The Application does not require registration or submission of personal information directly to our servers.</p>

    <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <p>When you use the Application, the following data types are automatically collected by integrated Google SDKs (AdMob, Google Play Services, Play Games Services, and Google Play Billing):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Advertising identifier</strong> (AAID/IDFA) and ad-interaction metrics</li>
        <li><strong>IP address, device model, OS version, and language</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Google account name and unique Google user ID</strong> (if you choose to sign in via Google Play Games)</li>
        <li><strong>Leaderboard scores and rankings</strong> (if you choose to sign in via Google Play Games)</li>
        <li><strong>Achievement completions</strong> (if you choose to sign in via Google Play Games)</li>
        <li><strong>Purchase history</strong> (in-app transaction records) when using the Billing SDK</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All of the above are transmitted directly from your device to Google’s servers over encrypted channels (HTTPS/TLS) and processed under Google’s Privacy Policies. We only have access to aggregated, anonymized reports; we do not store any of these data points on our own systems.</p>

    <h2>2. Location Data</h2>
    <p>The Application does <em>not</em> collect precise or approximate location information from your device.</p>

    <h2>3. In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>All in-app purchases are processed through Google Play Billing. We do not see or store your payment credentials. Our app may query Google Play for purchase history to restore consumables or subscriptions, but we do not retain that history.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>The Application uses the following Google SDKs, each of which receives data directly (non-anonymized) to provide its services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Play Services / Play Games:</strong> account name &amp; user ID</li>
        <li><strong>Google Play Billing:</strong> purchase history</li>
        <li><strong>Google Mobile Ads (AdMob):</strong> Advertising ID &amp; ad-interaction metrics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We only see aggregated analytics; individual-level data remains with Google. Please review their policies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AdMob Privacy &amp; Terms</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <strong>What are my opt-out rights?</strong>
    <p>You can halt all collection of information by uninstalling the Application. You may also opt out of personalized advertising from Google by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">https://www.google.com/settings/ads</a> on each device.</p>
    <p>If you prefer not to share your Google account name or ID with this app, you can disable Google Play Games integration by either:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Opening the <strong>Google Play Games</strong> app, tapping your profile avatar, and choosing <em>Sign out</em>.</li>
      <li>Visiting <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions">myaccount.google.com/permissions</a>, finding “StarBurst Idle” under “Third-party apps with account access,” and removing it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h2>
    <p>We do not retain user data on our servers. All data described above is retained by Google under their retention policies.</p>
    <p>To request deletion of any profile, purchase, or device-ID data, please visit our request page: <a href="https://bolsterentertainment.github.io/StarBurstIdle/delete-data" target="_blank">https://bolsterentertainment.github.io/StarBurstIdle/delete-data</a></p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Application is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from them. Any data generated is processed solely by Google’s SDKs; we do not store or access it.</p>
    <p>If you believe your child under 13 has used the app and wish to remove data, revoke the app’s access in Google permissions:</p>
    <ol>

    </ol>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect any information processed, but no security measure is foolproof.</p>
            
   <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Continued use of the Application constitutes acceptance of any changes.</p>
    <p><em>Effective date: 20 May 2025</em></p>
