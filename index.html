    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: 19 Dec 2025</em></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the <strong>StarBurst Incremental</strong> mobile application ("Application"), developed and published by Bolster Solutions ("Service Provider") as a 
        Freemium service. This service is provided "AS IS".</p><br>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>User Provided Information</h3>
    <p>The Application does not require registration or submission of personal information directly to our servers.</p>

    <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <p>When you use the Application, the following data types are automatically collected by integrated Google SDKs (AdMob, Google Play Services, Play Games Services, and Google Play Billing), Unity SDKs (Unity Services Core, Unity In-App Purchasing, and Unity Analytics), and our attribution provider Tenjin:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Advertising identifier</strong> (AAID/IDFA) and ad-interaction metrics</li>
        <li><strong>IP address, device model, OS version, and language</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Google account name and unique Google user ID</strong> (if you choose to sign in via Google Play Games)</li>
        <li><strong>Leaderboard scores and rankings</strong> (if you choose to sign in via Google Play Games)</li>
        <li><strong>Achievement completions</strong> (if you choose to sign in via Google Play Games)</li>
        <li><strong>Purchase history</strong> (in-app transaction records) when using the Billing SDK</li>
        <!-- Unity-specific minimal data -->
        <li><strong>Unity Installation ID</strong> (an app-specific identifier generated by Unity Services Core)</li>
        <li><strong>SDK diagnostics/metrics</strong> (e.g., SDK version and initialization status) required to operate Unity IAP</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics identifiers</strong> used by Unity Analytics (e.g., IP address and an app-specific user/installation identifier)</li>
        <li><strong>Gameplay/usage analytics events</strong> (e.g., session start/end, in game actions, watch ad event or purchase complete event)</li>
        <!-- Tenjin-specific minimal data -->
        <li><strong>Install attribution data</strong> (e.g., install referrer information and app open/session start events) used to attribute installs to ad campaigns <em>via Tenjin</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>We initialize Unity Services Core to enable Unity In-App Purchasing and Unity Analytics. We do not use Unity Ads or Unity Cloud Diagnostics.</p>
    <p>All of the above are transmitted directly from your device to Google’s, Unity’s, <strong>and Tenjin’s</strong> servers over encrypted channels (HTTPS/TLS) and processed under their respective Privacy Policies. We access reports and dashboards provided by Google, Unity, and Tenjin. These reports may include event-level analytics tied to app-scoped identifiers (for example, an installation/user identifier used by Unity Analytics). We do not operate our own servers to store this data.</p>

    <h2>2. Location Data</h2>
    <p>The Application does <em>not</em> collect precise or approximate location information from your device.</p>

    <h2>3. In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>All in-app purchases are processed through Google Play Billing. We do not see or store your payment credentials. Our app may query Google Play for purchase history to restore consumables or subscriptions, but we do not retain that history.</p>
    <p><em>Unity In-App Purchasing (IAP) is used as a wrapper around Google Play Billing; no payment credentials are sent to Unity.</em></p>

   <h2>4. Third-Party Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>The Application uses the following third-party SDKs (Google, Unity, and Tenjin), each of which receives data directly (non-anonymized) to provide its services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Play Services / Play Games:</strong> account name &amp; user ID</li>
        <li><strong>Google Play Billing:</strong> purchase history</li>
        <li><strong>Google Mobile Ads (AdMob):</strong> Advertising ID &amp; ad-interaction metrics</li>
        <li><strong>Unity Services (Services Core + Unity IAP + Unity Analytics):</strong> Unity Installation ID/app-scoped user identifier, IP address, and gameplay/usage analytics events (no payment credentials)</li>
        <li><strong>Tenjin (marketing attribution):</strong> Advertising ID, IP address, install referrer information, and app open/session events used solely to attribute installs and measure marketing performance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We only see aggregated analytics; individual-level data remains with the respective providers. Please review their policies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AdMob Privacy &amp; Terms</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unity Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.tenjin.com/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tenjin Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Advertising, Attribution &amp; Analytics</h2>
    <p>We use <strong>Tenjin</strong> to measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and understand how users discover our app. Tenjin processes device and install-attribution data (described above) to attribute installs to advertising sources and to provide aggregated reports to us. We do not use Tenjin for gameplay analytics.</p>
    <p>We also use <strong>Unity Analytics</strong> to understand app performance and player behavior using gameplay/usage events. Where required, we provide an in-app option to disable Unity Analytics data collection.</p>
    
    <strong>What are my opt-out rights?</strong>
    <p>You can opt out of <strong>Unity Analytics</strong> collection by using the in-app privacy/analytics toggle. When opted out, we do not start Unity Analytics data collection. You can also send a delete data request through the in-app options that will delete all collected analytics data within 30 days.</p>
    <p>You can halt all collection of information by uninstalling the Application. You may also opt out of personalized advertising from Google by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">https://www.google.com/settings/ads</a> on each device, and you can reset or limit use of your device’s Advertising ID in your device settings.</p>
    <p>If you prefer not to share your Google account name or ID with this app, you can disable Google Play Games integration by either:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Opening the <strong>Google Play Games</strong> app, tapping your profile avatar, and choosing <em>Sign out</em>.</li>
      <li>Visiting <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions">myaccount.google.com/permissions</a>, finding “StarBurst Incremental” under “Third-party apps with account access,” and removing it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h2>
    <p>We do not retain user data on our servers. All data described above is retained by <strong>Google, Unity, and Tenjin</strong> under their respective retention policies.</p>
    <p>To request deletion of any profile, purchase, or device-ID data, please visit our request page: <a href="https://bolsterentertainment.github.io/StarBurstIdle/delete-data" target="_blank">https://bolsterentertainment.github.io/StarBurstIdle/delete-data</a></p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>The Application is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from them. Any data generated is processed solely by Google’s and Unity’s SDKs; we do not store or access it.</p>
    <p>If you believe your child under 13 has used the app and wish to remove data, revoke the app’s access in Google permissions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Visit <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">myaccount.google.com/permissions</a></li>
        <li>Find "StarBurst Idle"</li>
        <li>Click "Remove Access"</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect any information processed, but no security measure is foolproof.</p>
            
   <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Continued use of the Application constitutes acceptance of any changes.</p>
    <p><em>Effective date: 19 Dec 2025</em></p>
