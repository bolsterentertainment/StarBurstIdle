    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: 16 May 2025</em></p>

    <p>This privacy policy is applicable to the StarBurst Idle app (hereinafter referred to as "Application") for mobile
        devices, which was developed by Bolster Solutions (hereinafter referred to as "Service Provider") as a 
        Freemium service. This service is provided "AS IS".</p><br>

    <strong>What information does the Application obtain
        and how is it used?</strong><br>
    
    <strong>User Provided Information</strong>
        <p>The Application does not require you to register or submit personal information.</p><br>

    <strong>Automatically collected information:</strong>  
        <p>When you run the Application, Google’s SDKs that are bundled with the app
        (AdMob, Google Play Services) automatically collect
        device and usage data, such as:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Advertising identifier (AAID/IDFA) and ad-interaction metrics</li>
            <li>IP address, device model, OS version and language</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>These data are sent directly from your device to Google’s servers and are
        processed in accordance with Google’s own privacy policies (see links
        below). We can access only <em>aggregated, anonymised</em> reports in the
        Google developer consoles; we never see your name, email address or
        precise hardware identifier.</p>

    <strong>Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the
        device?</strong>
        <p>This Application does not gather precise information about the location of your mobile device.</p><br>

    <strong>In-App Purchases</strong>
        <p>All in-game purchases are processed through the Google Play Billing system. We do not see or store your payment information; 
            Google handles all transaction details. Please refer to Google Play’s Terms and Privacy Policy for more information.</p><br>

    <strong>Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?</strong>
        <p>Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service Provider in
            improving the Application and their service. The Service Provider may share your information with third parties
            in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.</p>
        <div><br>
            <p>Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that process data on our behalf. 
                Below are the links to the Privacy Policy of the third-party service providers used by the
                Application:</p>

    <strong>What are my opt-out rights?</strong>
        <p>You can halt all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling the Application. You may use

    <strong>Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information</strong>
        <p>We do not store personal data on our own servers. All device and

    <strong>Children</strong>
        <p>The Application is not directed to children under 13 and we do not
            knowingly collect personal information from them. All data is processed
            solely by Google’s SDKs (AdMob, Google Play Services); we do not keep
            copies on our own servers.</p>
            
            <p>If we learn that personal data from a child under 13 has been
            submitted through those services, we will request its deletion from
            Google and disable further data collection for that user.  
            Parents or guardians who believe their child has provided personal
            information can contact us at

        <p>The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. The Service
            Provider provides physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and maintain.
            For example, we limit access to this information to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that
            information in order to operate, develop or improve their Application. Please be aware that, although we
            endeavor provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all
            potential security breaches.</p><br>
