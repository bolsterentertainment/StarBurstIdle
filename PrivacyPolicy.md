# Privacy Policy  
*Last updated: 16 May 2025*

This privacy policy applies to the **StarBurst Idle** app (the “Application”) for mobile devices, developed by **Bolster Solutions** (the “Service Provider”) as a **freemium** service. The service is provided **“AS IS.”**

---

## What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?

### User-Provided Information  
The Application **does not** require you to register or submit personal information.

### Automatically collected information  
When you run the Application, Google’s SDKs bundled with the app (AdMob, Google Play Services) automatically collect device and usage data, such as:

- Advertising identifier (AAID/IDFA) and ad-interaction metrics  
- IP address, device model, OS version and language  

These data are sent directly from your device to Google’s servers and are processed in accordance with Google’s own privacy policies (see links below). We can access only **aggregated, anonymised** reports in the Google developer consoles; we never see your name, email address or precise hardware identifier.

### Location data  
The Application **does not** gather precise information about the location of your mobile device.

---

## In-App Purchases  
All in-game purchases are processed through the Google Play Billing system. We do not see or store your payment information; Google handles all transaction details. Please refer to Google Play’s Terms and Privacy Policy for more information.

---

## Third-party access to data  
Only aggregated, anonymised data is periodically transmitted to external services to help us improve the Application and our service.  

Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that process data on our behalf. Their privacy policies are:

- [Google Play Services](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/)  
- [AdMob](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en)

The Service Provider may disclose User-Provided and Automatically Collected Information:

1. as required by law (e.g., to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process);  
2. when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;  
3. to trusted service providers who work on our behalf, have no independent use of the information we disclose to them, and have agreed to adhere to this privacy statement.

---

## What are my opt-out rights?  
You can stop all collection of information by the Application by uninstalling it via your device’s standard uninstall process.  
You can also opt out of personalised advertising from Google by visiting <https://www.google.com/settings/ads> on each device.

---

## Data retention  
We do **not** store personal data on our own servers. All device and usage data is transmitted directly to Google and is retained in line with Google’s own privacy policies.

---

## Children’s privacy  
The Application is **not directed to children under 13** and we do not knowingly collect personal information from them. All data is processed solely by Google’s SDKs (AdMob, Google Play Services); we keep no copies on our own systems.

If we learn that personal data from a child under 13 has been submitted through those services, we will request its deletion from Google and disable further data collection for that user.  
Parents or guardians who believe their child has provided personal information can contact us at <bolsterentertainment@gmail.com>.

---

## Security  
The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. We provide physical, electronic and procedural safeguards—for example, limiting access to authorised employees and contractors who need the information to operate, develop or improve the Application. Nevertheless, no security system can prevent all potential breaches.

---

## Changes  
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you by updating this page. Please review it periodically; continued use of the Application constitutes acceptance of any changes.

*Effective date: 16 May 2025*

---

## Your consent  
By using the Application, you consent to the processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy, including any future amendments.
