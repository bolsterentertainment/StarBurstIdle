    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="small">Last updated: 19 Dec 2025</p>
  </header>

  <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the <strong>StarBurst Incremental</strong> mobile application (the &ldquo;Application&rdquo;), developed and published by <strong>Bolster Solutions</strong> (the &ldquo;Service Provider&rdquo;) as a Freemium service. This service is provided &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo;.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3>User Provided Information</h3>
  <p>The Application does not require registration or submission of personal information directly to our servers.</p>

  <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
  <p>When you use the Application on iOS, the following data types may be collected automatically by integrated SDKs from Apple (Game Center and StoreKit), Google (AdMob), and Unity (Services Core, Authentication, In-App Purchasing, Cloud Save, and Analytics), as well as our attribution provider Tenjin:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Advertising identifier (IDFA)</strong> (if you grant tracking permission via App Tracking Transparency) and ad‑interaction metrics.</li>
    <li><strong>Device and app data</strong> such as IP address, device model, iOS version, language/locale, and app version.</li>
    <li><strong>Game Center</strong>: player alias and a platform‑specific <em>Game Center Player ID</em> (if you choose to sign in), plus leaderboard scores, rankings, and achievement completions that you submit.</li>
    <li><strong>Unity Authentication</strong>: a <em>Unity Player ID</em> created when you sign in using Game Center as the identity provider (no access to your Apple ID credentials).</li>
    <li><strong>Unity Cloud Save</strong>: your game progress/state saved to the cloud. This save is stored <strong>anonymously</strong> and is linked only to your Unity Player ID / Game Center identity.</li>
    <li><strong>Unity Analytics identifiers</strong> (e.g., IP address and an app-scoped installation/user identifier) used to measure app performance and usage.</li>
    <li><strong>Unity Analytics events</strong> (e.g., session events and in-game actions you choose to instrument as analytics events).</li>
    <li><strong>Purchase information</strong>: in‑app purchase transaction records used to validate and restore purchases via Apple In‑App Purchase (StoreKit).</li>
    <li><strong>Operational diagnostics and limited telemetry</strong> required to operate Unity IAP, Authentication, and Cloud Save on iOS (e.g., package version and initialization status).</li>
    <li><strong>Attribution data</strong> (e.g., IDFA if permitted, SKAdNetwork attribution signals/postbacks, and app open/session start events) used to attribute installs to ad campaigns via Tenjin</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Unity Services Core is initialized to enable <em>In-App Purchasing</em>, <em>Unity Authentication (via Game Center)</em>, <em>Unity Cloud Save</em>, and <em>Unity Analytics</em>. We do <strong>not</strong> use Unity Ads or Unity Cloud Diagnostics.</p>
  <p>All of the above are transmitted directly from your device to Apple&rsquo;s, Google&rsquo;s, Unity&rsquo;s, and Tenjin&rsquo;s servers over encrypted channels (HTTPS/TLS) and processed under their respective Privacy Policies. We access reports and dashboards provided by these partners; these may include event-level analytics tied to app-scoped identifiers (for example, identifiers used by Unity Analytics). We do not store these data points on our own systems.</p>

  <h2>2. Location Data</h2>
  <p>The Application does not collect precise or approximate location information from your device.</p>

  <h2>3. In‑App Purchases</h2>
  <p>All in‑app purchases are processed through <strong>Apple In‑App Purchase (StoreKit)</strong>. We do not see or store your payment credentials. Our app may query StoreKit for purchase history to restore consumables or subscriptions, but we do not retain that history.</p>
  <p><strong>Unity In‑App Purchasing (IAP)</strong> is used as a wrapper around Apple In‑App Purchase; no payment credentials are sent to Unity.</p>

  <h2>4. Third‑Party Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>The Application uses the following third‑party SDKs (Apple, Google, Unity, and Tenjin), each of which receives data directly to provide its services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Apple Game Center</strong>: player alias, Game Center Player ID, leaderboard and achievement submissions (when you sign in).</li>
    <li><strong>Apple In‑App Purchase (StoreKit)</strong>: in‑app purchase transaction details for validation and restore.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Mobile Ads (AdMob)</strong>: Advertising ID (IDFA, if permitted) and ad‑interaction metrics.</li>
    <li><strong>Unity Services</strong> (Services Core, IAP, Authentication, Cloud Save, Analytics): Unity Installation ID, Unity Player ID, SDK diagnostics/metrics; Cloud Save data (game state); Analytics identifiers and analytics events. No payment credentials.</li>
    <li><strong>Tenjin</strong> (marketing attribution): IDFA (if permitted), IP address, and SKAdNetwork/attribution events used solely to attribute installs and measure marketing performance.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Please review their policies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple Privacy Policy</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543">AdMob Privacy &amp; Terms</a></li>

    <li><a href="https://www.tenjin.com/privacy/">Tenjin Privacy Policy</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Advertising &amp; Attribution (Opt‑Out Options)</h2>
  <p>You can halt all collection of information by uninstalling the Application. You may also limit tracking and personalized advertising on iOS by doing any of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>On your device, go to <em>Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Tracking</em> and disable <em>Allow Apps to Request to Track</em>, or deny tracking for <em>StarBurst Incremental</em>.</li>
    <li>You can reset or limit use of the device advertising identifier (IDFA) via your iOS settings.</li>
    <li>You can disable <strong>Unity Analytics</strong> collection using the in-app analytics toggle. When disabled, the app stops sending Unity Analytics events from your device.</li>
    <li>If you prefer not to use Game Center, go to <em>Settings &gt; Game Center</em> and tap <em>Sign Out</em>. Some features (leaderboards/achievements) will be unavailable when signed out.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h2>
  <p>We do not retain user data on our own servers. Data described above is retained by Apple, Google, Unity, and Tenjin under their respective retention policies.</p>
  <p><strong>Unity Analytics deletion:</strong> You can request deletion of Unity Analytics data using the in-app analytics data deletion button. Unity states this records a deletion request event and results in the player’s analytics data being deleted within the next 30 days. If you choose to allow analytics again, new analytics data may be recorded again.</p>
  <p><strong>Cloud Save</strong>: Your cloud save is stored <strong>anonymously</strong>.</p>
  <p>To request deletion of any profile, saves, purchase, or device‑ID data held by our partners where applicable, please visit our request page: <a href="https://starburstidle.com/delete-data-ios">starburstidle.com/delete-data-ios</a>.</p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The Application is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from them. Any data generated is processed solely by the SDKs listed above; we do not store or access it.</p>
  <p>If you believe your child under 13 has used the app and wish to remove data, you can sign out of Game Center on the device (<em>Settings &gt; Game Center &gt; Sign Out</em>) and adjust tracking settings as described above.</p>

  <h2>8. Security</h2>
  <p>We implement reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect any information processed, but no security measure is foolproof.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Continued use of the Application constitutes acceptance of any changes.</p>
